# Project-01
https://stvnwslybwmnjr.github.io/Project-01/
This is a site designed to help mountain bike enthusiast plan trips around the continental united states.

Our first group project! Team Members Were Steven Bowman(team lead/Javascript), Calli Bonnet(Html/Css), Adriel Angeles(firebase).
The project started out very broad in scope, as a general outdoors website but once we saw what API's were reliable we narrowed it down to a mountain biking website. We nearly ran out of API's on presentation day, and the firebase was never added to the project. It was stressful yet fun!.
We learned alot about working as a team, cooridinating duties and merging github branches! We are all proud of what we accomplished!
